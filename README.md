Assignment 2 - Gem Puzzle
=========

##### WEBD 213 Motion Graphics 2
##### DUE: October 10th, 2014 @ 11:59 pm

##### Requirements:

1. Using the provided “Gem Puzzle” start files, do all 3 of the following components:

-- Change the tile graphics to something other than gems (e.g. fruits, planets, photos, heads, etc.)-- Create a new title that works with your theme and restyle the title, scores and final results text. Replace You win! with something more interesting.
-- Add a bit of your own style: maybe change the background to another colour or an image, that goes along with your theme.

2. Make use of CSS Transforms, Transitions and Animations to add motion design to the events in the game. In addition, you can modify the JavaScript to help get the effects you want (e.g. adding new css to elements at certain times, adjusting timers, etc). You want to make the game come alive more think subtle movement like a bounce, scale, fade, shifting, reactive etc. See other mobile games where they add feedback when tapping buttons, navigating, changes in game state, etc. It should come alive when the player interacts with it and for feedback. Here are some areas that are lacking some motion, do **ALL** of the following (you may add more of your own if you like, but these are key):

-- Selecting a tile (“gem”)
-- When matches are found (right now they just disappear after 0.5s)
-- When the matches score changes-- When the game is over (reached the required matches)

3. Change one thing about the game. This is meant to get your creative ideas going so use your imagination OR if you’re really stumped, try ONE of the following:

-- Alter the number of rows and columns (you will have to modify the html as well as let the javascript new the new dimensions)
-- Adding a countdown or lose condition-- 1 more object to the mix (currently it is 3)
